📞 Call Center KPI Dashboard - PwC Virtual Experience Program
This repository showcases a Call Center KPI Dashboard created as part of the PwC Virtual Case Experience Program through the Forage platform. The project involved developing a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze key call center metrics and provide actionable insights for improving performance.

📝 Project Overview
The objective of this project was to track and analyze various performance indicators within a call center, such as customer satisfaction, agent efficiency, and call resolution rates. The dashboard provides a clear visualization of the data, helping stakeholders identify areas of excellence and opportunities for improvement.

🔑 Key KPIs Implemented
Overall Customer Satisfaction

Measure: Average satisfaction rating across all calls.
Visualization: Gauge chart showing average satisfaction and a line chart tracking trends over time.
Overall Calls Answered vs Abandoned

Measure: Count of answered vs abandoned calls.
Visualization: Donut chart showing the proportion of answered vs abandoned calls.
Calls by Time

Measure: Number of calls at different times of day.
Visualization: Bar chart displaying call volume during various time intervals.
Average Speed of Answer

Measure: The average time taken to answer calls.
Visualization: KPI card showing average speed of answer and a line chart displaying trends over time.
Average Talk Duration

Measure: The average duration of conversations between agents and customers.
Visualization: Gauge chart to track talk duration and line chart for trends.
Agent Performance (Quadrant Chart)

Measure: Agent call handling efficiency (calls answered vs average talk duration).
Visualization: Quadrant chart to analyze agent performance with color-coded satisfaction scores.
Resolved vs Unresolved Calls

Measure: Proportion of resolved vs unresolved calls.
Visualization: Donut chart to show the breakdown of resolved and unresolved calls.
Call Volume by Topic

Measure: Number of calls categorized by different topics (e.g., tech support, billing).
Visualization: Bar chart showing distribution of calls by topic.
